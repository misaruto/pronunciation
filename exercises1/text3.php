								Best Careers for the Future
								<br>
							</h3>
							<p>
								Finding employment that is going to be profitable can be a challenge. This challenge is faced by many young individuals. The following is a list of fields that have the potential to grow and provide suitable employment now and in the future.

							</p>

							<p>
								<h4 class="text-center">
									Sustainability
								</h4>
								Individuals who study sustainability will focus their studies on the environment. Additional emphasis is put on ways to manage resources and ethics. Individuals who choose to study in this field are setting themselves up to work in an area that will experience growth for decades to come.
							</p>

							<p>
								<h4 class="text-center">
									Public Health Sector
								</h4>
								The public health sector will constantly need well-trained doctors, nurses, and technicians. There are multiple factors that indicate that the public health sector will grow over the next few decades. One factor is the rise in population. The second factor is the ever present threat of global epidemics.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4 class="text-center">
									Robotics
								</h4>
								Robotics is influencing every aspect of modern life. Anesthesia Bots are being used to assist with surgery. Oceanographers are also using robotics to allow them to map the watery depths where humans currently cannot travel. As space travel continues to become more and more important, robotics are being included in things such as surveying the surface of foreign planets and engaging in exploratory missions.
							</p>
							<p>
								<h4 class="text-center">
									Petroleum Engineering
								</h4>
								In recent years, advances in technology have made it possible for oil companies to retrieve oil from shale formations that just a decade ago could not be tapped. Because of this, there has been a sharp increase in the need for petroleum engineers. This increase is exacerbated by the fact that more than half of the current petroleum engineers working plan to retire within 10 years.
