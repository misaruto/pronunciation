								Foster Mother's Unconditional Love Helps Children Overcome Odds
								<br>
							</h3>
							<p>
								Lynda Sparks has taken care of over 20 foster children in the past eight years - most of whom are medically fragile, traumatized or come from difficult situations.

							</p>

							<p>
								This Mother's Day, she has five foster children in her home including 1-year-old twins (one of whom doctors doubted would live to see her first year) and a set of three siblings ages 3, 9 and 10.
							</p>

							<p>
								"When you experience the pain they go through and you see their grief and pain, it's a different kind of bond," said Sparks. "They've attached themselves to my heart."
							</p>
							<p>
								The single mother also has three grown children of her own.
							</p>
							<p>
								Things have not always been easy for Sparks, but she knows she has plenty of love to give and that's the most important gift you can give someone.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I've always believed with enough love you can achieve anything," she said. "I just really believe that and I've seen it over and over."
							</p>
							<p>
								"I just know with the right amount of help these children can be great adults."
							</p>
							<p>
								Watching the transformation of one of her own children led Sparks to become a foster mother.
							</p>
							<p>
								"I've raised my own three children and one of them had a lot of behavioral and emotional issues and it was tough but he's turned into a great adult," she said.
